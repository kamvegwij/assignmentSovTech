# What I Used:
I made use of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). for creating the app.
# How to bootstrap my project:
- If you have nextjs installed on your systemm then in your cmd and in an appropriate folder run the following command
  npx create-next-app [name of your project] -e https://github.com/kamvegwij/assignmentSovTech
- Note that name of your project can be any name for your new app
- Once done run command "cd [name of project]" and finally to run on a development server "npm run dev"
- So now you will have a new nextjs app of the template of my app.

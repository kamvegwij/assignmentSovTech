# What I Used:
I made use of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to create the initial app.
The project is mainly composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# How to bootstrap my project:
- If you have nodejs [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system then in your cmd and in an appropriate folder run the following command
- npx create-next-app newkamveapp -e https://github.com/kamvegwij/assignmentSovTech
- Note that name of your project can be any \nname for your new app, here I called it 'newkamveapp'.
- Now run -> cd kamveapp and npm run dev
- So now you will have a new nextjs app of the template of my app.
